# nextflow_on_jupyter

This repo is meant to teach the basic concepts involved with setting up and beginning 
to use the [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io) workflow language and system. 

To use, simply clone this repo and then start up the jupyter notebook. The notebook 
uses a `bash` kernel, so you can copy the command lines to the terminal if you'd 
rather not use jupyter. 

The scripts in the 0X_example... directories are self-contained and are very simple 
and not too useful nextflow workflows. They are meant to serve as scaffolding from 
which to start to build real workflows.
